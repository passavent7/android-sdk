##Warning:
You are viewing the sources of the 1.0.0 **Release Candidate**. The SDK is not released as a fully supported, stable version. Feel free to explore it anyways.

#Last stable release

Until 1.0.0 is released stable, please see the old [samples page](https://github.com/sensorberg-dev/android-sdk-samples) page for all neccesary information. As soon as the SDK is released properly, all samples will be updated as well.

#Integration

#Build,Test,Deploy

##Dependencies:
* JDK 1.7
* Build tools as stated in the build.gradle files
* check the install_android_dependencies.sh file for a list of currently needed packages.

This project is based on a standard Android Gradle setup. Run

```
	./gradlew tasks
```
to see all the tasks.

```
	./gradlew clean connectedAndroidTest
```
will run all the unit tests.

If you wish to run the tests with your own resolver:

set the system variable **RESOLVER_URL**

```
 	export RESOLVER_URL=http://168.168.0.1:8080/layout
```
or pass **resolver_url** to the build script:

```
	./gradlew connectedAndroidTest -Presolver_url=http://168.168.0.1:8080/layout
```

#Release

Set your release name in the root **build.gradle**. If you want a regular release, leave the **project.ext.RC_VERSION** as an empty string.

paste your credentials in the **bintray.properties** file.

``` bash
	./gradlew clean cAT android-sdk:bintrayUpload
```

If you want to test the procedure, change the **dryRun** variable in the **bintrayUpload.gradle** file to *true* temporarely. The --info flag will give you details if you need them.

``` bash
	./gradlew clean android-sdk:bintrayUpload --info
